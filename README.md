# Computational Methods Labs

This repo holds the labs done during the module.

## Lab 1

Finite differences

## Mock assessment

Compile all the files into an executable with name `mock` with `g++` using `g++ -std=c++17 -o mock *.cpp`. This compile all the `.cpp` files in the current directory and create an executable with name `mock`.

Alternatively, run the project using `./runMock.sh`. This shell script will compile and run the project.
